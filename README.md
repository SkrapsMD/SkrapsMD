# Hey there! I'm Michael Dwight Sparks (SkrapsMD)

No, I'm not a doctorâ€”just blessed with initials that let me play with usernames like SparkySparksMD and SkrapsMD. (If you see me elsewhere online and it's not one of these handles, it's probably not actually me!)

I'm a larval-stage economist applying to PhD programs this fall, currently working as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta with [SalomÃ© Baslandze](https://sites.google.com/site/sabaslandze/home) and [Lei Fang](https://sites.google.com/site/leifang/). My research focuses on innovation, industrial policy, and macro-labor.

Here's some work I've done with my Atlanta Fed colleagues:


>### **Tariffs and Consumer Prices**
>**February 2025** | [Atlanta Fed Policy Hub](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/publications/policy-hub/2025/02/28/01--tariffs-and-consumer-prices) <br>
> *Summary:* We evaluate the impact of various US tariff scenarios on consumer prices using novel micro-level data linking imports to consumer expenditures. Results indicate that an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, and 10 percent tariff on other countries could raise consumer prices on everyday retail purchases, such as food and beverage items and general merchandise, covering about a quarter of the total consumption basket, by 0.81 percent to 1.63 percent, assuming half to full pass-through. Notably, tariffs on Canada and Mexico contribute approximately 45 percent of the total price effect. Our results focus on direct effects of tariffs on a quarter of the total consumption basket, and the aggregate effect on the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) further hinges on the price sensitivity of the excluded consumption categories, particularly transportation, services, energy, and housing. <br>

>### **Labor Supply of Newly Immigrated Workers**
>**August 2024** | [Atlanta Fed Macroblog](https://www.atlantafed.org/blogs/macroblog/2024/08/19/labor-supply-of-newly-immigrated-workers)<br>
> *Summary:* How do newly immigrated workers compare to native born workers? This policy blog uses ACS data to investigate the potential macroeconomic effects of 2024 CBO revisions of immigration figures. When immigrants first arrive, they lag behind native born workers in Labor Force Participation Rate, Annual Hours worked, and average number of weeks worked. By their fifth year, these work as much as native workers, and by their 10th year they consistently out-work native born workers across time, and in all three measures.<br>

When I'm not economizing, I'm likely tinkering with robotics or woodworkingâ€”or both simultaneously! Open to collaboration in this space, especially if you have machine vision experience.
