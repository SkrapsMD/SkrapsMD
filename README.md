Hey There! I'm Michael Dwight Sparks (SkrapsMD). To start with, no I'm not a M.D., I am just unoriginal and happen to have first and middle initials that let me do fun things like SparkySparksMD, and, as you see here SkrapsMD (these are the usernames for all of my 'professional' accounts, if its not one of those, or linked here, its probably not me!

I'm a larval stage economist (applying to PhD programs Fall 25) currently in a research Analyst Position at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta working with [SalomÃ© Baslandze](https://sites.google.com/site/sabaslandze/home) and [Lei Fang](https://sites.google.com/site/leifang/). My interests are in innovation, industrial policy, and macro-labor. You can read some of my published work with colleagues at the Atlanta Fed here: 


>### **Tariffs and Consumer Prices**
>**February 2025** | [Atlanta Fed Policy Hub](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/publications/policy-hub/2025/02/28/01--tariffs-and-consumer-prices)
> *Summary:* We evaluate the impact of various US tariff scenarios on consumer prices using novel micro-level data linking imports to consumer expenditures. Results indicate that an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, and 10 percent tariff on other countries could raise consumer prices on everyday retail purchases, such as food and beverage items and general merchandise, covering about a quarter of the total consumption basket, by 0.81 percent to 1.63 percent, assuming half to full pass-through. Notably, tariffs on Canada and Mexico contribute approximately 45 percent of the total price effect. Our results focus on direct effects of tariffs on a quarter of the total consumption basket, and the aggregate effect on the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) further hinges on the price sensitivity of the excluded consumption categories, particularly transportation, services, energy, and housing.

>### **Labor Supply of Newly Immigrated Workers**
>**August 2024** | [Atlanta Fed Macroblog](https://www.atlantafed.org/blogs/macroblog/2024/08/19/labor-supply-of-newly-immigrated-workers)
>
> *Summary:* How do newly immigrated workers compare to native born workers? This policy blog uses ACS data to investigate the potential macroeconomic effects of 2024 CBO revisions of immigration figures. When immigrants first arrive, they lag behind native born workers in Labor Force Participation Rate, Annual Hours worked, and average number of weeks worked. By their fifth year, these work as much as native workers, and by their 10th year they consistently out-work native born workers across time, and in all three measures.

When I'm not economizing, I'm likely doing fun stuff with robotics or woodworking (or both at the same time! Open to collaboration in this space -- looking for someone with more machine vision experience).
